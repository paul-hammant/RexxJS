# RexxJS Reference Documentation

A comprehensive reference guide to all RexxJS features, organized by category.

## Execution Mode Overview

RexxJS supports three distinct execution modes, each designed for different use cases and control architectures:

### 1. **Autonomous Web Mode**
Direct browser execution where the RexxJS interpreter runs independently within a single web context. The script controls its own execution flow with no external orchestration. Ideal for interaction with standalone web applications, white-box browser automation, and client-side scripting.

### 2. **Controlled Web Mode** 
Browser execution using a Director/Worker architecture with two iframes communicating via postMessage. An external director orchestrates execution, providing real-time control (pause/resume/abort), progress monitoring, and distributed workflow coordination. Designed for complex multi-step processes requiring external supervision.

### 3. **Command-line Mode**
Execution in Node.js environments (desktop, server, docker-style container or VM) with full file system access but no web/DOM capability. While a programming language attempting to use instead of bash will lead to longer scripts.

*Detailed documentation for each mode is provided in the sections below and in dedicated function references.*
