-- test-spreadsheet-address.rexx
-- ARexx-style spreadsheet control demonstration
--
-- Usage:
--   1. Start spreadsheet with control bus:
--      ./rexxsheet-dev --control-bus
--
--   2. Run this script in another terminal:
--      ../../core/rexx test-spreadsheet-address.rexx
--
-- This demonstrates classic ARexx-style IPC
